# My Favorite Series and Movie

## Favorite Series: **Loki**
I love the concept of:
- Messing with **time**
- Exploring the **multiverse**
- Diving into the **infinite possibilities** that a person has in the universe

## Favorite Movie: **Avengers: Endgame**
Everything about it is just **perfect**. I saw it in the theatres, and it still gives me **goosebumps** every time!
